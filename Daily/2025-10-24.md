- [x] Scan over $gR$ for 
	- [x] /h0 h1 h2 h3
	- [x] /Zp h0 h1 h2 h3
- [x] Scan over $\sqrt{s}$ for MWp = (1000 ... 5000)
	- [x] / NaN
	- [ ] for a single MWp value
		- [ ] /h0 h1 h2 h3 
		- [ ] /Zp h0 h1 h2 h3
- [ ] Plot MZp in all graphs

- [ ] reproduce fig1
- [ ] see why so much big cross section

- [ ] reproduce $\cos \theta$ distribution
- [ ] implement forward backward asymmetry
	- [ ] implement it by editing the source files generated by normal mode
	- [ ] implement it manually in expert mode
