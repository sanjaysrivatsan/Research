# TODO
- [ ] Understand what all the files are, how they are connected
	- [ ] What are the variables, functions and values
- [ ] How tree processes are generated, how loop processes are generated, what is the difference
- [ ] See the exact code in the files responsible for loop processes and how to implement

# DONE
- Found out the files that generate diagrams, both tree and loop
- Found a paper [[1405.0301v2.pdf]] which is the standard reference for the use of the code
