- [x] implement diff xsec and AFB - fig 4b -- polarise $\mu^-$
	- [x] / none
	- [x] / h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
	- [x] / Zp h0 h1 h2 h3 a2

is it wrong to polarise $\mu^+$ instead of $\mu^-$ ?
no, but to compare, you need both

- [x] implement diff xsec and AFB - fig 4e -- polarise $\mu^-$
	- [x] / none
	- [x] / h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
	- [x] / Zp h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
