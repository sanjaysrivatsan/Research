- [x] Plot MZp in all graphs in matplotlib
	- [x] make a script to read lhe files and produces ebeam1 ebeam2 polbeam1 polbeam2 gR vevp MWp MZp
	- [x] make a script that reads run_* of a cross section data file produced by print_results and match it with the file with MZp in it and join both of the columns
	- [x] plot fig2a
	- [x] fig2b
	- [x] fig2c
- [ ] fig3a
- [ ] fig3b
- [ ] fig3c
- [ ] fig4a
- [x] implement diff xsec and AFB - fig 4a
	- [x] / none
	- [x] / h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
	- [x] / Zp h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
- [ ] reproduce fig1 --- see decay BR

- [ ] understand the code
- [ ] understand the LHE format, the event file and event blocks

- [ ] polarization graphs gR=0.64 (default)
	- [ ] / none
	- [ ] / h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
	- [ ] / Zp h0 h1 h2 h3 a2

what is the goal?
- to get MZp values on an axis on the graphs
How to get those?
