- [ ] Plot MZp in all graphs
	- [ ] make a script to read cross section data file, -> vevp and gR and calculate MZp
		- [ ] make a script that matches gR values in a cross section file and adds a MZp column
	- [ ] or directly get from madgraph
- [ ] implement diff xsec and AFB - fig 4a
	- [x] / none
	- [x] / h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
	- [x] / Zp h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
- [ ] reproduce fig1 --- see decay BR

- [ ] understand the code
- [ ] understand the LHE format, the event file and event blocks

- [x] polarization graphs gR=0.37
	- [x] / none
	- [x] / h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
	- [x] / Zp h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
- [ ] polarization graphs gR=0.64 (default)
	- [ ] / none
	- [ ] / h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
	- [ ] / Zp h0 h1 h2 h3 a2

what is the goal?
- to get MZp values on an axis on the graphs
How to get those?
-
