- [ ] reproduce $\cos \theta$ distribution
- [ ] implement forward backward asymmetry
	- [ ] implement it by editing the source files generated by normal mode
	- [ ] implement it manually in expert mode
- [ ] Learn C++ fundamentals to be more comfortable with the expert mode

I need to complete this so that I can have some progress. I feel like whatever I've tried to do, I left it in between.
Figure it out.

- [ ] reproduce fig1
- [ ] make notes of plots, to talk in meeting
- [ ] Learn about muon collider, polarization, branching ratios, etc
- [ ] see why so much big cross section
- [x] scan for a fixed MWp = 5000 value, over gR to get
