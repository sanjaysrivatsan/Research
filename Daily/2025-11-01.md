	- [ ] / none
	- [ ] / h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
	- [ ] / Zp h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
- [ ] reproduce fig1 --- see decay BR

- [ ] understand the code
- [ ] understand the LHE format, the event file and event blocks

- [ ] polarization graphs gR=0.64 (default)

	- [ ] / h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
	- [ ] / Zp h0 h1 h2 h3 a2

what is the goal?
- to get MZp values on an axis on the graphs
How to get those?
