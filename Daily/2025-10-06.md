- [x] generate mu mu~ > h h in madgraph first in sm
- [x] generate mu+ mu- > vm vm~ h h
- [ ] then in alrm
- [x] restrict diagrams mu+ mu- > vm vm~ h h \$$ z
- [x] mu-Z coupling in mu+ mu- > z h, Z channel
- [x] check processes with charged higgs instead of W+ 
- [ ] check decays
- [ ] check how to eliminate background processes, cuts
- [x] merge tree level processes

# Question
- [ ] How do I know which are the signal processes and which are the background processes?
- [ ] I need to select a few diagrams with the particles w, wp, hp1, hp2
