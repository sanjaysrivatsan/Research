- [ ] check muon collider
- [ ] try in madgraph mu+ mu- > vm vm~ h h to select diagrams by diagram number??? not possible ig
- [x] madanalysis
- [ ] check decays
- [ ] check how to eliminate background processes, cuts
- [ ] try madanalysis p p > h h
- [ ] [[2412.05787v1-reproduce.pdf]] reproduce these results
- [x] reproduce cross section vs $g_R$ 
- [x] reproduce the polarisation graph
- [ ] reproduce $\cos \theta$ distribution
- [ ] implement forward backward asymmetry
	- [ ] implement it manually in expert mode
	- [ ] implement it by editing the source files generated by normal mode
- [ ] do mu+ mu- > e+ e- ~ne ~ne~ , not necessarily W' channel
- [x] install pythia
