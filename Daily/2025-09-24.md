# Slide 1
- Good afternoon, I am Sanjay. I'll be talking about my PhD proposal
- My PhD is about the BSM physics in the context of Left-Right scenarios at the LHC and beyond

---
# Slide 2
- This is the outline of my presentation
- I'll give a brief introduction, followed by literature discussion and research gaps. Then about research objectives, methodology, expected outcomes, impact and significance and the research timeline of my PhD journey

---
# Intro 
- Let me start by giving a brief yet incomplete introduction about the Standard Model
- We know that SM successfully explains the fundamental particles which make up matter and their interactions
- It is based on the Gauge group --------- which is broken down into -------
- One peculiarity about the SM is that parity is maximally violated in weak interactions, there are left handed neutrinos but no right handed neutrinos
- Experimental evidence for this comes from the Wu experiment

---
# Intro 2
- In SM, the left-handed leptons and quarks are structured into doublets, where as the right handed leptons and quarks are singlets.
- But there is no explanation why it should follow this structure

---
# Literature review: Left-Right Scenarios
- LRSMs provide equal footing for left and right handed particles and provides a theoretical explanation for the chiral asymmetry of the SM at low energies
- It is based on the gauge group, as you can see there is an extra SU(2)R which allows for right handed fermions to be structured as doublets
- This Left-Right symmetry is broken at some high energy scale to the SM symmetry
- It was studied by Pati, Salam, Mohapatra and Senjanovic
- LRSM predicts new particles and interactions which are testable in high energy colliders as well as low-energy experiments

---
# Literature Review: ALRM
- The Left-Right symmetry can be seem as emerging from a Grand Unified group E6, we can derive it in various ways2
- It differs from the usual LRSM mainly in its assignment of right handed fermion doublets
- It was studied by Ma, Babu, Mariana Frank and more people
- ALRM also avoids the large tree-level flavour changing neutral interactions which forces the right handed sector of the LRSM into a high TeV range

---
# Recent Studies done by our group
- Some studies done on top flavour and lepton flavour violation of these decays in ALRM
- Branching ratios of these decays are enhanced upto $10^6$ relative to SM
- Thus it is a good time to study the phenomenological signatures of these scenarios

---
# Minimal extensions
- Some minimal extensions exist which explore dark matter sector
- Some studies on Vector like fermion singlet, vector like fermion pair were explored and also a gauge singlet scalar dark matter with spontaneous CP Violation
- Also studies were done to explain the fermion mass hierarchy and neutrino mass generation at three loop level

---
# Research gaps
- We can explore the implications of these left-right models on specific collider signatures to test the viability of these models
- We can also derive various versions of these left-right scenarios from the grand unified E6 group. Also, we can explore potential minimal extensions to these models
- We can study the effects of the Renormalization group on the particle spectra and dark matter sector
- Also, the influence of these models on the gravitational wave spectrum, potential sources, amplitude predictions for GW observatories can be studied as it may yield some new important restrictions on the parameter space of these models

---
# Objectives
- We will study experimental signatures associated with existing models at the LHC and future colliders and assess constraints from existing data to find out good experimental detection strategies
- We will examine the existing left-right models and also explore formulation of new models at TeV scale, which can provide some interesting signatures and solve the problems of existing models
- We will analyse the restrictions on the parameter space of existing and new models according to cosmological phenomena and renormalization group analysis

---
# Methodology - Collider Analysis
- We will do some collider analysis, using computational tools
- We will generate UFO model files using the FeynRules package to perform NLO computation with MadGraph5 and generate events and compare the results with current data from experiments using MadAnalysis
- We will also evaluate the possibility of discovering new particles from these models at LHC and Future Colliders, focusing on decay signatures like dilepton pairs, processes that violate lepton flavour and jet-lepton resonances

---
# Methodology - Theoretical Framework
- We will explore existing models and formulate new Left-Right models at the TeV scale incorporating both the gauge and Higgs sector
- We will also study the breaking of the left-right symmetry at high scales and study how masses of the new exotic states depend on model parameters

---
# Methodology - Phenomenology
- These models predict new particles and interactions WR and ZR bosons, and the additional higgs particles. We will study the mass spectrum of the model and the interactions with SM particles
- Renormalization group analysis will be done to check the implications on the particle spectra 
- We will study the implications of these models on low-energy processes like lepton-flavour violation, rare decays and anomalous magnetic moment of muon

---
# Methodology - DM and GW
- We will focus on constraints to be imposed on the model from direct and indirect detection and collider experiments with the goal of directing future experiments to test these models
- We will explore the possible sources of GW within these frameworks and constrain the model parameters based on observed data and identify unique signatures

---
# Resources

---
# Outcomes
- We hope to identify rare decays and collider signatures and for these models at the TeV scale
- Also to determine constraints for the mass spectrum and coupling strengths of these new predicted particles based on current and future experimental data
- Try to predict new physics that could be observed at the LHC and future colliders, including unique signatures of Higgs particles and other exotic states
- We hope to suggest new observables and indicate the presence of LR symmetry at the TeV scale

---
# Impact and Significance
- This will deepen our understanding of the Left-Right models at the TeV scale, providing predictions and comparing with experimental data
- The outcomes will lead to a deeper understanding of neutrino physics, dark matter, GW and potential new physics beyond the standard model
