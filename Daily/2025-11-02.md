- [ ] implement diff xsec and AFB - fig 4b
	- [ ] / none
	- [ ] / h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
	- [ ] / Zp h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
I need to run mg5 for fixed gR = 0.65 and MWp = 2 TeV and scan cross section over Pmu+ (polbeam2) while keeping Pmu- (polbeam1) = 0 and then plot the differential cross section angular distribution for different runs (polbeam2 values)


- [ ] reproduce fig1 --- see decay BR

- [ ] understand the code
- [ ] understand the LHE format, the event file and event blocks

- [x] polarization graphs gR=0.64 (default)
	- [x] / none
	- [x] / h0 h1 h2 h3 a2
	- [x] / Zp h0 h1 h2 h3 a2

what is the goal?
- to get MZp values on an axis on the graphs
How to get those?
