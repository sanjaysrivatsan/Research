Use of AI does significantly improve my work output, but in the meantime, I cannot perform my tasks if I was to work without AI tools.
So I should take a nuanced position about this and try to use it for the benefits only

I should use GenAI only for the code related stuff, and learn physics of the processes by studying and solving problems

I should write about what I did everyday and also the physics happening behind it
