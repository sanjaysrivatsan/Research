The design [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_\(scattering_theory\) "Luminosity (scattering theory)") of the LHC is 1034 cm−2s−1,[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider#cite_note-40) which was first reached in June 2016.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider#cite_note-designlumireached-41) By 2017, twice this value was achieved.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider#cite_note-endof2017-42)
### "High-luminosity" upgrade

Main article: [High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Luminosity_Large_Hadron_Collider "High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider")

After some years of running, any particle physics experiment typically begins to suffer from [diminishing returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns "Diminishing returns"): as the key results reachable by the device begin to be completed, later years of operation discover proportionately less than earlier years. A common response is to upgrade the devices involved, typically in collision energy, [luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity_\(scattering_theory\) "Luminosity (scattering theory)"), or improved detectors. In addition to a possible increase to 14 TeV collision energy, a luminosity upgrade of the LHC, called the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, started in June 2018 that will boost the accelerator's potential for new discoveries in physics, starting in 2027.[[179]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider#cite_note-179) The upgrade aims at increasing the luminosity of the machine by a factor of 10, up to 1035 cm−2s−1, providing a better chance to see rare processes and improving statistically marginal measurements.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider#cite_note-autogenerated1-116

This will increase its instantaneous luminosity (rate of collisions) by a factor of five beyond the original design value and the integrated luminosity (total number of collisions) by a factor ten.
